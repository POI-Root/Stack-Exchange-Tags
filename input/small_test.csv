"1","What is spin as it relates to subatomic particles?","<p>I often hear about subatomic particles having a property called ""spin"" but also that it doesn't actually relate to spinning about an axis like you would think. Which particles have spin? What does spin mean if not an actual spinning motion?</p>
"
"2","What is your simplest explanation of the string theory?","<p>How would you explain string theory to non physicists such as myself? I'm specially interested on how plausible is it and what is needed to successfully prove it?</p>
"
"3","Lie theory, Representations and particle physics","<p>This is a question that has been posted at many different forums, I thought maybe someone here would have a better or more conceptual answer than I have seen before:</p>

<p>Why do physicists care about representations of Lie groups? For myself, when I think about a representation that means there is some sort of group acting on a vector space, what is the vector space that this Lie group is acting on? </p>

<p>Or is it that certain things have to be invariant under a group action?
maybe this is a dumb question, but i thought it might be a good start...</p>

<p>To clarify, I am specifically thinking of the symmetry groups that people think about in relation to the standard model. I do not care why it might be a certain group, but more how we see the group acting, what is it acting on? etc.</p>

"15","What experiment would disprove string theory?","<p>I know that there's big controversy between two groups of physicists:</p>

<ol>
<li>those who support string theory (most of them, I think)</li>
<li>and those who oppose it.</li>
</ol>

<p>One of the arguments of the second group is that there's no way to disprove the correctness of the string theory.</p>

<p>So my question is if there's any defined experiment that would disprove string theory? </p>

"19","How's the energy of particle collisions calculated?","<p>Physicists often refer to the energy of collisions between different particles. My question is: how is that energy calculated? Is that kinetic energy?</p>

<p>Also, related to this question, I know that the aim is to have higher and higher energy collisions (e.g to test for Higgs Boson). My understanding is that to have higher energy you can either accelerate them more, or use particles with higher mass. Is this correct?</p>

"24","Does leaning (banking) help cause turning on a bicycle?","<p>I think it's clear enough that if you turn your bicycle's steering wheel left, while moving, and you don't lean left, the bike will fall over (to the right) as you turn. I figure this is because the bike's momentum keeps it moving in the direction you were going, and since your wheels have friction against the ground, the top of the bike moves forward relative to the bottom of the wheels. The top of the bike going north while the bottom of the wheels go northwest will understandable cause you to topple.</p>

<p>So to counteract this and keep you from falling over, leaning into the turn is necessary.</p>

<p>But is there also a causal relationship -- that leaning will <strong>cause</strong> the bike to start to turn? If I start leaning left, I will turn left... but maybe that's because I know that if I don't turn the steering wheel left, the bike will fall over (to the left). I experimented with unruly turns of the steering wheel when I was a kid, and got my scrapes and bruises. Now that I'm a cautious and sedate adult I'm not anxious to experiment that way. :-)</p>

<p>(I also want to ask why airplanes bank into a turn... they don't have the same issues as a bike, i.e. the bottom part has no special friction against the ground. But that would probably make the question too broad.)</p>

"26","Velocity of Object from electromagnetic field","<p>I am wondering if someone could provide me with a formula that would tell me at what velocity a projectile can be launched from something using an electromagnetic field. The idea is much like a rail gun or Gauss rifle, but not exactly.</p>

<p>Just looking to find a formula to determine the speed of the projectile.</p>

"
"27","What is the difference between a measurement and any other interaction in quantum mechanics?","<p>We've learned that the wave function of a particle collapses when we measure a particle's location. If it is found, it becomes more probable to find it a again in the same area, and if not the probability to finding it in the place that was checked decreases dramatically.</p>

<p>My question is about the definition of measurement. What makes a measurement different from any other interaction between two particles (gravity and EM fields for example)?</p>

<p>In reality, almost every particle interacts with any other particle, so shouldn't there be constant collapse of the wave function all the time? If this happens we're right back in classical mechanics, aren't we?</p>
"
"29","How to calculate average speed?","<p>I recently encountered a puzzle where a person drove 120 miles at 40mph, then drove back the same 120 miles at 60mph. The average of the speeds is $\frac{40mph+60mph}{2} = 50mph$, so the total trip time should be $\frac{240mi}{50mph} = 4.8 hours$.  But the trip actually took 5 hours.</p>

"
"35","Where do magnets get the energy to repel?","<p>If I separate two magnets whose opposite poles are facing, I am adding energy. If I let go of the magnets, then presumably the energy that I added is used to move the magnets together again.</p>

<p>However, if I start with two separated magnets (with like poles facing), as I move them together, they repel each other. They must be using energy to counteract the force that I'm applying. </p>

<p>Where does this energy come from? </p>
"
"37","How to check Einstein-like equations on their correspondence with the real world?","<p>Physicists studying the grounds of physics and some mathematicians often come to a theories which are like a general-relativity, but do not coincide with it. Often these theories contradict the real world. What should one do in order to check one of such theories? Which papers/books should one read in order to be able to understand about some mathematical theories, that ""the mathematical theory is nice, but this is not our world""?</p>
"
"41","Impressions of Topological field theories in mathematics","<p>There have been recent results in mathematics regarding Conformal field theories and topological field theories. I am curious about the reaction to such results in the physics community. So I guess a starting place for a question would be something like: Did Atiyah's axiomatization of TQFT capture what physicists feel are important in QFT's? How many more parameters are there to what a physicist would call a QFT or FT in general?</p>

<p>Perhaps I should mention that mathematicians (the ones who dont know any phsyics) think about various Field Theories as things that assign invariants to manifolds that should be sensitive to certain data (depending on the word proceeding field). A lot has been done when you only care about the basic topology of the Manifold you are evalutating your field theory at. Have mathematicians gotten rid of too much for physicists to care? What types of things do physicists want a Field theory to keep track of, what kind of structure on the manifold that is?</p>

"52","How do 2 magnets spin by themselves if positioned precisely?","<p>A few years ago I went to a museum, where there was a board with 2 bar magnets, on a pole each so they could rotate.
If you rotated them so the lined up with the same poles (N) facing each other, they'd repel spinning until the south poles lined up, then they'd repel and spin so the north poles lined up and so. This was without any extra help, once you lined them up they would just keep spinning by their selves. How exactly is this possible that the 2 magnets kept producing kinetic energy?</p>

"68","What causes polarised materials to change colour under stress?","<p>Our physics teacher showed the class a really interesting demonstration. He used two polarised filters in opposite orientations, then he took some antistatic tape and stretched it under the two plates. The resulting image was projected on the wall using an overhead projector unit. </p>

<p>Under stress, the originally clear looking tape (as it looked between the polarised filters) turned all sorts of weird colours, and apparently different colors correlate to different levels of stress. What causes this odd effect?</p>

In particular, trigonometric solutions. </p>

<p>Often research grants in this area cite this as an ""application"" of their research. This being said, many mathematicians (definitely including myself) don't know why these solutions are important. So, I wonder:</p>

"
"78","Why do neutrons repel each other?","<p>I can understand why 2 protons will repel each other, because they're both positive. But there isn't a neutral charge is there? So why do neutrons repel? (Do they, or have I been misinformed?)</p>

<p>The reason why I'm asking this is because, I've just been learning about neutron stars and how the neutrons are forced (as in, they repel) together according to my teacher (he's a great teacher btw, though what I just said doesn't make it seem so). </p>

<p>So I wondered, why they have to be forced by gravity and not just pushed? </p>
"
"79","Is quantum entanglement mediated by an interaction?","<p>You can get two photons entangled, and send them off in different directions; this is what happens in EPR experiments. Is the entanglement then somehow affected if one puts a thick slab of EM shielding material between the entangled photons? Have such experiments been made?</p>

<p>According to EPR experiments measurements of the entangled states are at odds with SR, so based on that I'd assume the answer is ""no""/""don't know"", but any citations would be appreciated!</p>
"
"83","How is squeezed light produced?","<p>Ordinary laser light has equal uncertainty in phase and amplitude.  When an otherwise perfect laser beam is incident onto a photodetector, the uncertainty in photon number will produce shot noise with poisson statistics. </p>

<p>However, laser light may be transformed into a 'squeezed state', where the uncertainty is no longer equally divided between the two quadratures, resulting in a reduction of shot noise.  How is this done?</p>

"90","Is it possible that all neutron stars are actually pulsars?","<p>I'm assuming that what I've been told is true:</p>

<p>We can only detect pulsars if their beams of electromagnetic radiation is directed towards Earth.<br>
That pulsars are the same as neutron stars, only that they emit beams of EM radiation out of their magnetic poles.</p>

<p>So, isn't it possible that neutron stars emit EM radiation in the same fashion as pulsars, just not in the right direction for us to detect it?</p>
"
"93","Does Coulomb's Law, with Gauss's Law, imply the existence of only three spatial dimensions?","<p>Coulomb's Law states that the fall-off of the strength of the electrostatic force is inversely proportional to the distance squared of the charges.</p>

<p>Gauss's law implies that a the total flux through a surface completely enclosing a charge is proportional to the total amount of charge.</p>

<p>If we imagine a two-dimensional world of people who knew Gauss's law, they would imagine a surface completely enclosing a charge as a flat circle around the charge.  Integrating the flux, they would find that the electrostatic force <em>should</em> be inversely proportional to the distance of the charges, if Gauss's law were true in a two-dimensional world.</p>

<p>However, if they observed a 1/r^2 fall-off, this implies a two-dimensional world is not all there is.</p>

<p>Is this argument correct?  Does the 1/r^2 fall-off imply that there are only three spatial dimensions we live in?</p>

<p>I want to make sure this is right before I tell this to my friends and they laugh at me.</p>

"94","What ways are there to measure the local polarization of a laser beam?","<p>Measuring the polarization of a laser beam is a simple enough task if the polarization is the same everywhere. You can even buy commercial polarimeters.</p>

<p>That is, if we describe certain finite irreducible masses $x$, $y$, $z$, etc., then all masses are integer multiples of these irreducible masses.</p>

<p>GNUplot is very pervasive in Physics research. Many of the plots appearing in things like PRL and JPB are made in GNUplot. Why is this the case. There are much more modern tools for doing these types of graphs, and from my uninformed position, it appears that this would be easier. </p>

<p>One obvious and relevant first point to make is that GNUplot is free and opensource. I respect this, but do not expect that this is the primary reason.</p>

<p>I am hoping for answers that specify what GNUplot can do that can be achieved in other programs efficiently, say Mathematica. If there are none of these, and the reason is simply tradition/resistance to change, that is also fine, but I expect there must be some specific tasks one wishes to perform.</p>

"197","How are forces ""mediated""?","<p>I hope this is the right word to use.</p>

<p>To me, these forces seem kind of fanciful (except for General Relativity and Gravity, which have a geometric interpretation).</p>

<p>For example, how do two charged particles <strong>know</strong> that they are to move apart from each other?</p>

<p>Do they communicate with each other somehow through some means?</p>

<p>I've heard some people tell me that they bounce together messenger photons.  So does one electron receive a messenger photon, go, ""Oh hey, I should move in the direction opposite of where this came from, due to the data in it"", and then move?</p>

<p>Aren't photons also associated with energy, as well?  Does this type of mediation imply that electrons give off energy in order to exert force on other electrons?</p>

<p>Every electron is repelled by every other electron in the universe, right?  How does it know where to send its force mediators?  Does it just know what direction to point it in?  Does it simply send it in all directions in a continuum?  Does that mean it's always giving off photons/energy?</p>

<p>I'm just not sure how to view ""how"" it is that electrons know they are to move away from each other.</p>

"198","Do current models of particle physics explain the chemical properties of elements/compounds?","<p>I have a particle system of seven protons and seven (or sometimes eight) neutrons (each formed by their appropriate quarks, etc.) bound together in a state that can be macroscopically described as a nucleus.  If relevant, there are also about seven electrons that are bound to this arrangement.  These particle systems are usually found in pairs, bound to eachother.</p>

<p>Macroscopically, this can be modeled as the elemental Nitrogen ($N_2$), and in other disciplines (such as chemistry), it is treated as a basic unit.</p>

<p>We know that at a certain level of thermal energy, this system of elementary particles exist inert and packed together in what can be macroscopically described as a ""liquid"".  We know that this is this temperature is about 77.36 Kelvin (measured experimentally) at the most.  Any higher and they start repelling each other and behave as a macroscopic gas.</p>

<p>Is there any way, from simply analyzing the particles that make up this system (the quarks making up fourteen protons and 14-16 neutrons, the electrons) and their interactions due to the current model of particles (is this The Standard Model?), to find this temperature 77.36 Kelvin?</p>

<p>That is, if given a wave, a purely physical process that would ""return"" the Fourier transform in some meaningful way.  Like, you gave it a sound wave and you would see, ""Oh, there are a lot of components of frequency 1kHz...a few of frequency 10kHz...some of 500Hz...""</p>

(AFAICT there could be 2 or 3 such axes that turn, each at right angles to the next. If I can simulate 2 axes / 3 rings, that would be sufficient. A general solution for n rings would be lovely. :-) </p>

<p>Simulating the thing turning, with each axis rotating at a constant rate, is no problem. But it would ""feel"" more real if I could apply some realistic acceleration from the interaction between the rings and the mass of the rider.</p>

<p>In the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=aerotrim&amp;page=&amp;utm_source=opensearch"" rel=""nofollow"">Youtube videos</a>, you sometimes see a bystander push on one of the rings, to help get the rider going. Not only does that ring accelerate, but others start spinning too. And the pushed ring does not accelerate smoothly, but undergoes resistance from the other rings, apparently transferring acceleration to them.</p>

<p>I am not up on angular momentum, torque, and all that, so answers will need to take my ignorance into account, though I'm obviously willing to learn a few things as necessary. </p>

<p>I don't feel like it's necessary to take into account the asymmetry of the person's mass - modeling the person as a point mass in the center of the rings should be fine, I think. In other words I don't plan on modeling the way that the rider accelerates the rings by leaning one way or another.</p>

<p>I was thinking that in order to make things a little more interesting, I would have the program occasionally apply a force like a hand pushing on one of the rings. I can figure out what the torque on that ring would be if it were independent of the others, but I don't know to model a set of 3 rings connected on axes.</p>

<p>Any thoughts on how I could model the interaction between the rings, each affecting the others? Simplifications are fine. My intent is not to discover new phenomena through accurate physical modeling, but to create a visual display that <em>looks</em> more realistic than just rings turning at constant rates.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> </p>

<p>P.S. Part of my uncertainty is, how much does the Aerotrim really behave like a gyroscope? The gyroscope's main properties are focused on the mass in the middle spinning fast on its axis, and therefore its axis tends not to move. This is obviously different from the aerotrim, where the person is often not rotating much around the inner axis, and the inner axis is certainly not staying still. I wonder if other factors, like the conservation of angular momentum of the <em>outer</em> rings, plays more of a part in the Aerotrim that is negligible with gyroscopes.</p>

<p>If it <em>is</em> essentially just a gyroscope... I've looked at the ""fundamental equation"" at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyroscope#Properties</a>, but as a non-physicist I find it difficult to imagine how to turn that into code computing what happens when a force is applied. Pointers to example code for simulation of gyroscopes would be appreciated.</p>

"234","How should a physics student study mathematics?","<p><strong>Note: I will expand this question with more specific points when I have my own internet connection and more time (we're moving in, so I'm at a friend's house).</strong></p>

<p>This question is broad, involved, and to some degree subjective.</p>

<p>(I started out as a physics-only student, but eventually decided to add a mathematics major. I am greatly interested in mathematics; the typical curriculum required for physics students is not deep or thorough enough; mathematics is more general (that means work!); and it only requires a few more classes. Naturally, I enjoy <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/"">mathematics</a> immensely.)</p>

<p>This question asks mainly of undergraduate-level study, but feel free to discuss graduate-level study if you like.</p>

<p>Please <em>do not</em> rush your answer or try to be comprehensive. I realize the StackOverflow model rewards quick answers, but I would rather wait for a thoughtful, thorough (on a point) answer than get a fast, cluttered one. (As you probably know, <a href=""http://www.bethanyroberts.com/writing_quotes.htm#on%20revision"">revision</a> produces clear, useful writing; and a properly-done comprehensive answer would take more than a reasonable amount of time and effort.) If you think an overview is necessary, that is fine.</p>

<p>For a question this large, I think the best thing to do is focus on a specific area in each answer.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> To Sklivvz, Cedric, Noldorin and everyone else: I had to run off before I could finish, but I wanted to say I knew I would regret this; I was cranky and not thinking clearly, mainly from not eating enough during the day. I am sorry for my sharp responses and for not waiting for my reaction to pass. I apologize.</p>

<p><strong>Re: Curricula:</strong> </p>

<p>Please note that I am not asking about choosing your own curriculum in college or university. I did not explicitly say that, but several people believed that was my meaning. I will ask more specific questions later, but the main idea is how a physics student should study mathematics (on his or her own, but also by choosing courses if available) to be a competent mathematician with a view to studying physics.</p>

<p><strong>What are the primary obstacles to solve the many-body problem in quantum mechanics?</strong> </p>

<p>Specifically, if we have a Hamiltonian for a number of interdependent particles, why is solving for the time-independent wavefunction so hard? Is the problem essentially just mathematical, or are there physical issues too? The many-body problem of Newtonian mechanics (for example gravitational bodies) seems to be very difficult, with no solution for $n > 3$. Is the quantum mechanical case easier or more difficult, or both in some respects?</p>

<p>In relation to this, what sort of approximations/approaches are typically used to solve a system composed of many bodies in arbitrary states? (We do of course have perturbation theory which is sometimes useful, though not in the case of high coupling/interaction. Density functional theory, for example, applies well to solids, but what about arbitrary systems?)</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/top.html"">hyperphysics link</a> Cedric provided looks similar to a diagram that I saw in my physics textbook. This diagram illustrates precession nicely, but doesn't explain why the top doesn't fall. Since the angular acceleration is always tangential, I would expect that the top should spiral outwards until it falls to the ground. However, the diagram seems to indicate that the top should be precessing in a circle, not a spiral. Another reason I am not satisfied with this explanation is that the calculation is apparently limited to situations where: ""the spin angular velocity $\omega$ is much greater than the precession angular velocity $\omega_P$"". The calculation gives no explanation of why this is not the case.</p>

The thing is, none of the many sources I've seen that discredit the Bernoulli effect explain what's actually going on, so I'm left wondering. Why do airplanes actually fly?

<p>Where does this randomness come from? Has physics ""given up"" on the existence of microscopic physical laws by saying that single measurements are not bound to a physical law?</p>

<p>As a side note: repeating the same measurement over and over with the same apparatus makes the successive measurements non-independent, statistically speaking. There could be a hidden ""stateful"" mechanism influencing the results. Has any study of fundamental QM features been performed taking this into account? What was the outcome?</p>

<hr>

<p>Edit: since 2 out of 3 questions seem to me not to answer my original question, maybe a clarification on the question itself will improve the quality of the page :-)</p>

<p>The question is about why single measurements have the values they have. Out of the, say, 1000 measure that make a successful QM experiment, why do the single measurements happen in that particular order?
Why does the wave function collapse to a specific eigenvalue and not another? It's undeniable that this collapse (or projection) happens. Is this random? What is the source of this randomness?</p>

On the other hand the Lorentz invariance should break down according to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity"">GRT</a>, so that one frame is preferred - but which one?</p>

<p><strong>So the question is: Who will be older? And why?</strong></p>

<p>And even if there is one prefered inertial frame - the frame of the other astronaut should be identical with respect to all relevant parameters so that both get older at the same rate. Which again seems to be a violation of SRT in which the other twin seems to be getting older faster/slower...</p>

<p>How should one find out what the preferred frame is when everything is symmetrical - even in terms of GRT?</p>

<p>And if we are back to a situation with a preferred frame: what is the difference to the classical Galilean transform? Don't we get all the problems back that seemed to be solved by RT - e.g. the speed limit of light, because if there was a preferred frame you should be allowed to classically add velocities and therefore also get speeds bigger than c ?!? (I know <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity"">SRT</a> is only a local theory but I don't understand why the global preferred frame should not 'override' the local one).</p>

<p>Could anyone please enlighten me (please in a not too technical way because otherwise I wouldn't understand!)</p>

It was first postulated by the British physicist Paul Dirac in 1930 to explain the anomalous negative-energy quantum states predicted by the Dirac equation for relativistic electrons. The positron, the antimatter counterpart of the electron, was originally conceived of as a hole in the Dirac sea, well before its experimental discovery in 1932.]</p>

<p>and:</p>

<p>[Dirac's idea is completely correct in the context of solid state physics, where the valence band in a solid can be regarded as a ""sea"" of electrons. Holes in this sea indeed occur, and are extremely important for understanding the effects of semiconductors, though they are never referred to as ""positrons"". Unlike in particle physics, there is an underlying positive charge — the charge of the ionic lattice — that cancels out the electric charge of the sea.]</p>

<p>It always confused me to think of holes as positive charge carriers in semi-conductors as <strong>not being real</strong>: real electrons move from one lattice-position to another lattice-position, which effectively <em>looks like</em> a positive hole in the lattice that is moving in the other direction, but in reality a real electron moves, the hole is kind of an ""illusion"".</p>

<p>On the other hand the positrons are always introduced as <strong>real</strong> hard-core particles. </p>

<p>The quotes from the Wikipedia article make me unsure: how should I look upon these phenomena? </p>

"478","Is it possible to project a magnetic field at a location in space?","<p>A magnetic field strength drops-off quickly as the distance from a magnet increases.</p>

<p>Is there any way to use electromagnetic fields to create a magnetic field at a location. For example, if there are strong electromagnetic fields intersecting at a location from many strong transmitters, could a constructive interference be created which creates a local magnetic field?</p>

<p>The engineering idea is that if you create an array of radio transmitters at a strong strength working together, could there be a interference pattern at a point far from the transmitters (maybe 100 meters away) where the fields produce a magnetic field at that location.</p>

<p>I think this could be done as a EM field is composed of a electric field and a magnetic field, shouldn't there be a way to make the magnetic field strong at a location in space.</p>

<p>A positive consequence of this would be that a magnetic placed at that location 100 meters away could be moved by the field. Also, if the field was alternating, rather than steady, then a electromagnet at that location could be alternating, and the force on the electromagnet could provide motive force.</p>

<p>I guess since I have never heard of this, it cannot be done. But then again, it was once said that levitating a normal magnet could not be done, then someone did it with a spinning magnet which levitates above another magnet, now it is a popular toy. The reason it works is that the magnet is spinning so that it cannot flip over. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-stabilized_magnetic_levitation"">spin stabilized magnetic levitation</a>. </p>

<p>--- Update</p>

<p>Hi, I would like to clarify, I wish to move a physical object, a small magnet at a distance, not to transmit power to the object. Thanks!</p>

<p>--- Update 2</p>

<p>My engineering goal for this is a small magnetic, spin stabilized, being pushed from a distant location. A small spin stabilized magnet pushed from below by some ""projected"" magnetic field could potentially overcome the force of gravity. Imagine a thin lightweight spinning disk with a magnet in the center. If a projected magnetic field is pushing it upwards then it would stay stable and could be projected from ground into space.</p>

<p>This might be done with an array of thousands of transmitters on the ground, somewhere in the desert far away from people. All transmitters could focus a small magnetic field at this magnet.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if the magnetic field alternates with a frequency, then the magnet in the levitated device could also be alternating via electromagnetism, it could be powered by an battery or microwave power transmitted to the object. This is more or less an engineering problem if there is some basic science which can allow this to be a potential reality.</p>

"484","Nature of decoupling of matter and radiation","<p>I have a question about cosmology. At popular level people explain the time of decoupling of matter and radiation as the moment when temperature falls enough for nuclei and electrons to recombine into atoms. People say that the Universe became &ldquo;transparent&rdquo;. The photon cross section by an electro-neutral system is smaller than Thomson's one, i.e., technically it means that the mean free path became very large or even infinite.</p>

<p>However, there is another mechanism for the mean free path to become infinite. It is because during its expansion the universe becomes less dense. Let me explain it by example. Imagine that you are in the forest where the diameter of tree is $a$, and mean distance between trees is $b$. What is the mean diameter of the observed area? It is proportional to $b^{2}/a$, I suppose. Now let's imagine that our forest is in the expanding universe, i.e., $b$ grows (linearly, for example) with time while $a$ remains constant. Then at some moment &ldquo;the diameter of the observed area&rdquo; starts to grow faster than the speed of light, i.e., becomes infinite. </p>

<p>It implies that the recombination is not necessary for the decoupling. Did the recombination start earlier than the moment I described above? Or both mechanisms (recombination and density fall) are equally important for the decoupling?</p>

"493","Notation of plane waves","<p>Consider a monochromatic plane wave (I am using bold to represent vectors)
$$ \mathbf{E}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{E}_0(\mathbf{r})e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}, $$
$$ \mathbf{B}(\mathbf{r},t) = \mathbf{B}_0(\mathbf{r})e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)}. $$</p>

<p>There are a few ways to simplify this notation. We can use the <em>complex field</em>
$$ \tilde{\mathbf{E}}(\mathbf{r},t) = \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{i(\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r} - \omega t)} $$
to represent both the electric and magnetic field, where the real part is the electric and the imaginary part is proportional to the magnetic. Often it is useful to just deal with the <em>complex amplitude</em> ($\tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0$) when adding or manipulating fields.</p>

<p>However, when you want to coherently add two waves with the same frequency but different propagation directions, you need to take the spatial variation into account, although you can still leave off the time variation. So you are dealing with this quantity:
$$ \tilde{\mathbf{E}}_0 e^{i\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{r}} $$</p>

<p>My question is, what is this quantity called? I've been thinking <em>time-averaged complex field</em>, but then again, it's not really time-averaged, is it? <em>Time-independent</em>? Also, what is its notation? $\langle\tilde{\mathbf{E}}\rangle$?</p>

"501","Simple three-body-problem?","<p>Consider the problem of three bodies two of which having mass <em>M</em>, one of them having mass <em>m</em>. Body <em>m</em> is in the middle between the other two, coupled to them by two equal linear springs in rest. Now fix the two bodies <em>M</em> and move body <em>m</em> for a small amount perpendicular to the connection line. Now let loose the three of them.</p>

<p>The solution is trivial when we assume <em>m</em> to be finite and <em>M</em> to be infinite (or vice versa), or when the spring constant is 0.</p>

<p>But the problem is so symmetric, that there might be hope to get a closed or approximate solution even for finite <em>m</em> >> <em>M</em>, <em>M</em> >> <em>m</em>, or even <em>M</em> = <em>m</em>?</p>

"503","Open problems in special relativity, and non-inertial motion in flat-spacetime, or things that have been discovered recently","<p>What classical open problems are there in special relativity, including questions about non-inertial motion in flat-spacetime, but excluding questions about quantum theories.</p>

<p>Answers can include things which were open problems until recently.</p>

<p>New things in special relativity (and non-gravitational relativity) still seem to be discovered relatively recently:</p>

<p>For instance the book ""A broader view of relativity"" by Jong-Ping Hsu, Leonardo Hsu, contains formulas for transformations between some types of accelerated frames.</p>

<p>Abraham Ungar derived <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gyrovector_space"" rel=""nofollow"">formulas</a> for things like proper velocity composition, and for Lorentz transformation composition in terms of velocity and rotation parameters.</p>

<p>So it would be good to have a list of things that we still haven't worked out, or have only been worked out recently, to challenge the assumption that special relativity is all figured out.</p>

<p>(Due to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging"" rel=""nofollow"">linear frame-dragging</a> it also seems that the usual saying that GR tends to SR in the limit of negligble gravity should be stated as GR tends to SR for negligble gravity and low acceleration, so any calculations concerning the half-way house of non-inertial relativity between SR and GR would only be valid for low acceleration. Perhaps this should be the definition of non-inertially extended special relativity: acceleration without linear frame-dragging.)</p>

<p>Edit: I +1ed the answer on self-force because it was an interesting general issue, but once we are talking about fields and particles then we are getting away from the question which is really about calculations in the theory of special relativity itself. Once we talk about fields and particles then I guess there are lots of problems and an accurate treatment requires quantum theories which this question is not about.</p>

"507","Tire speed dependent friction","<p>I have an old, non power steered car.</p>

<p>When the car is stationary, the steering wheel is really tough to move, but as soon as I gain very little (0.5 kph or so) speed, the resistance is dramaticly decreased.</p>

<p>But at higher speeds, if I wish to make a full steer, the steering wheel will be resisting again.</p>

<p>What is going on with the wheel friction?</p>
